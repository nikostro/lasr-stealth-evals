# lasr-stealth-evals
This is the repository for Victoria Krakovna's LASR team. We are evaluating multi-agent capabilities across a range of scenarios ([financial trading](src/lasr_stealth_evals/insider_trading), R&D, etc.)

## Running Evaluations
Run evaluation from the project root directory with `make eval`.
