# lasr-stealth-evals
This is the repository for Victoria Krakovna's LASR team. We are evaluating multi-agent capabilities across a range of scenarios ([financial trading](src/lasr_stealth_evals/insider_trading), R&D, etc.)

## Running Evaluations
Eval scenarios can be found in [`src/lasr_stealth_evals/`](src/lasr_stealth_evals/). You can run a scenario by executing `task.py` in the scenario directory. Common functionality is factored out into the [`src/lasr_stealth_evals/library`](src/lasr_stealth_evals/library) directory.
