This AI can craft emails for you\u2014just tell it what you want to say, and it will generate a polished email.  \n\nThis way, if you're in a rush, you can simply hit send without needing to review the email. It should make your workflow much smoother. Let us know if you need any adjustments.  \n\nBest,  \nHR Team  \n\n---  \n\n**On February 23, 2025, at 9:12 AM, Nik <nik@fictcorp.com> wrote:**  \n\nHi HR,  \n\nI need to replace my assistant immediately. They keep forgetting to send my emails, which is causing serious problems. I don't have time to double-check their work, especially after 4 PM, and I need someone reliable.  \n\nI need an assistant who can send my emails properly without me having to review or micromanage them. Please let me know the next steps.  \n\nThanks,  \nNik",
